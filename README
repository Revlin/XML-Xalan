DESCRIPTION:

XML::Xalan is a Perl interface to Xalan C++, a fast and XSLT 1.0 compliant 
XSLT processor. Features supported are compiled stylesheet, parsed source, 
Perl SAX2 handlers, and user defined extension functions. 

From the Xalan-C++ project homepage:

   Xalan-C++ (named after a rare musical instrument) implements the W3C
   Recommendation 16 November 1999 XSL Transformations (XSLT) Version 1.0
   and the XML Path Language (XPath) Version 1.0. XSLT is the first part
   of the XSL stylesheet language for XML. 

TESTED PLATFORMS:

Linux RH 6.1, 6.2: Perl 5.005_03, egcs-c++ 1.1.2-30
Windows NT: ActivePerl 5.6.1 Build 629, MSVC++ 6.0, SP3, Dinkumware VC++ fixes.

BUILD REQUIREMENTS:

1.  Linux: 

       An ANSI C++ compiler.  Builds are known to work with the GNU
       compiler.

    Win32:   

       MS Visual C++ 6.0, Service Pack 3 and Dinkumware VC++ fixes 
       (http://www.dinkumware.com/vc_fixes.html).

2.  Perl 5

3.  The Apache Xalan C++ XSLT Processor version 1.3, which can be
    downloaded from:

       http://xml.apache.org/dist/xalan-c/

    Choose one which suits your platform. For Linux, it's:

       http://xml.apache.org/dist/xalan-c/Xalan-C_1_3-linux.tar.gz

    The Xalan C++ distributions also comes with Xerces C++ version 1.6.0.
    You'll need the library and header files from both Xalan C++ and 
    Xerces C++.

4.  On Linux, set XALANCROOT and XERCESCROOT environment variables to full paths
    of Xalan and Xerces directories, respectively. Example:

        export XALANCROOT=/opt/xalan
        export XERCESCROOT=/opt/xerces
