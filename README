XML::Xalan --  Perl interface to Xalan, an XSLT processor by Apache XML
Project.

This is free software, you may use it and distribute it under the same
terms as Perl itself. Copyright (c) 2001 Edwin Pratomo.

DESCRIPTION:

Starting from version 0.20, this distribution contains only
XML::Xalan::Transformer module, a straightforward interface to 
XalanTransformer class. Since version 1.2.0 of Xalan, this class has been
much improved, and now supports important features such as compiled
stylesheet, parsed source, and user defined function. 

In Xalan 1.1, XalanTransformer's features are quite minimal, so 
XML::Xalan module was written to provide an alternative API which is more
complete. But now with the current state of XalanTransformer, XML::Xalan 
module which is harder to maintain (since the interfacing is done at lower
level classes) seems to go nowhere, and I've decided to discontinue it. 

From the Xalan-C++ project homepage:

   Xalan-C++ (named after a rare musical instrument) implements the W3C
   Recommendation 16 November 1999 XSL Transformations (XSLT) Version 1.0
   and the XML Path Language (XPath) Version 1.0. XSLT is the first part
   of the XSL stylesheet language for XML. 

TESTED PLATFORMS:

Perl 5.005_03 (Linux), egcs-c++ 1.1.2-30

BUILD REQUIREMENTS:

1.  An ANSI C++ compiler.  Builds are known to work with the GNU
    compiler.  

2.  Perl 5

3.  The Apache Xalan C++ XSLT Processor version 1.1, which can be
    downloaded from:

       http://xml.apache.org/dist/xalan-c/

    Choose one which suits your platform. For Linux, it's:

       http://xml.apache.org/dist/xalan-c/Xalan-C_1_2-linux.tar.gz

    The Xalan C++ distributions also comes with Xerces C++ version 1.5.1.
    You'll need the library and header files from both Xalan C++ and 
    Xerces C++.

4.  Set XALANCROOT and XERCESCROOT environment variables to full paths
    of Xalan and Xerces directories, respectively. Example:

        export XALANCROOT=/opt/xalan
        export XERCESCROOT=/opt/xerces

BUILDING:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
