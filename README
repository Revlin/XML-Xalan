XML::Xalan --  Perl interface to Xalan, an XSLT processor by Apache XML
Project.

This is free software, you may use it and distribute it under the same
terms as Perl itself. Copyright (c) 2001 Edwin Pratomo.

DESCRIPTION:

This distribution consists of three modules: XML::Xalan::Transformer,
XML::Xalan, and XML::Xerces::ParserLiaison.

XML::Xalan::Transformer is a straightforward interface to XalanTransformer 
class, and XML::Xalan provides high-level, easy-to-use object oriented 
interface to other Xalan C++ classes. XML::Xerces::ParserLiaison is required 
in order to use XML::Xerces with XML::Xalan.

From the Xalan-C++ project homepage:

   Xalan-C++ (named after a rare musical instrument) implements the W3C
   Recommendation 16 November 1999 XSL Transformations (XSLT) Version 1.0
   and the XML Path Language (XPath) Version 1.0. XSLT is the first part
   of the XSL stylesheet language for XML. 

TESTED PLATFORMS:

Perl 5.005_03 (Linux), egcs-c++ 1.1.2-30

BUILD REQUIREMENTS:

1.  An ANSI C++ compiler.  Builds are known to work with the GNU
    compiler.  

2.  Perl 5

3.  The Apache Xalan C++ XSLT Processor version 1.1, which can be
    downloaded from:

       http://xml.apache.org/dist/xalan-c/

    Choose one which suits your platform. For Linux, it's:

       http://xml.apache.org/dist/xalan-c/Xalan-C_1_2-linux.tar.gz

    The Xalan C++ distributions also comes with Xerces C++ version 1.5.1.
    You'll need the library and header files from both Xalan C++ and 
    Xerces C++.

4.  Set XALANCROOT and XERCESCROOT environment variables to full paths
    of Xalan and Xerces directories, respectively. Example:

        export XALANCROOT=/opt/xalan
        export XERCESCROOT=/opt/xerces

5.  XML::Xerces version 1.5.x, available from:

        http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces-p/

    This is optional, needed only if you want to feed a DOM tree built 
    by XML::Xerces into an XML::Xalan object for transformation.

BUILDING:

    perl Makefile.PL
